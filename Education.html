                    As girls, we study and we are expected to study just like anyone else. However, it wasn't the same
                    for our grandmothers. We tried putting ourselves in our grandmother’s shoes and we thought as much
                    as we don’t like school sometimes, we wouldn’t want to stay home after 6th grade. It seems weird and
                    exotic. The education department states that the percentage of college graduates who are women is
                    56%, which is a huge difference from how much our grandmothers had studied.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    In our generation, it comes to us as a big shock if we are told that someone did not finish their
                    high school education. We are expected that we go to college after high school to study trade,
                    medicine, law, business, etc. We also don’t work for our livelihood as kids. Our lives mostly
                    consist of school, homework, sports, extracurriculars, friends, etc. Working for our living or our
                    family is not something many of us do though it was common in our grandparents' generation.

                            <p class="paragraph">We talked to Medhana's grandfather found out that in his family of 6
                                siblings (1 sister and 5 brothers) most of his brothers had some form of education after
                                10 grade. However, his sister and one brother were only able to study until 10th grade. We
                                also found out that even as they studied and went to school they still had to work. Our
                                grandparents talked about how they had to help with farming in the early mornings and
                                evenings while attending school during the other times. And as for studying or doing
                                homework, they had to do it by candlelight in the nights. </p>

                            <p class="paragraph">For our grandmothers, it was another story. Medhana's grandmother only
                                studied until SIXTH grade. That was a big surprise to us because that is younger than
                                our current age. We all have heard about how in the olden days' girls wouldn’t study
                                much but we thought they would at least finish their high school (in India high school
                                is only until 10th grade). Sruthi's grandma, had studied until 9th grade which is a bit
                                more than how much girls usually were allowed to study.

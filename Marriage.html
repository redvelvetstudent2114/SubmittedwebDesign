                <p class=paragraph>
                    In a study done in 2018, it was found that the median age of marriage was 30 years for men and 28
                    years for women which is nearly double the age of when our grandmothers got married. When thinking
                    about the fact that our grandmas were married around 13- 14 years old but our moms got married after
                    all their education was over and once they started working. We thought whoa there is such a big
                    difference just between our grandparents' generation and our parents' generation.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We just started high school this year as freshmen. Right now, our thoughts and goals are about our
                    parents, siblings, friends, grades, college, and careers. We can speak for most high schoolers when
                    we say that marriage is not a thought that we think about at this point in our lives. We understand
                    that marriage is something that will happen but we don’t really think about it like something that
                    will happen anytime soon.

                                As for men most of them get married once they find a job and seem pretty settled in
                                life. However, it was a bit different for Medhana's grandpa because he got married
                                during his training for his B. Ed (Bachelor of Education). However, as soon as his
                                training was complete he got a job at a private school and then a government school for
                                he worked for a little less than 35 years. But with Sruthi's grandpa, he finished civil
                                engineering before he got married.

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                We talked to our grandmothers about marriage. They told us that even though they got
                                married at around our age now it was considered pretty late for them because generally
                                girls would get married when they were in 7th or 8th grade. When we heard this we were
                                shocked, I don’t know why but it seemed silly to us when we heard this. But it is the
                                truth and it is how many marriages especially in India happened at that time.

                    How do you spend time with your grandparents on breaks and vacations? We look forward to this time
                    when we get to stay with our grandparents and get pampered. Our lives now as teenagers consist of
                    school, home, parents, friends, homework, and so on. However, have you ever had thought about how
                    your grandparents grew up? Surely we all understand that our grandparents' life growing up is not
                    like it is for us now. Have you thought about the many differences between our and our grandparents'
                    childhoods? While looking at it in the big picture, our lives might seem similar with parents,
                    siblings, education, etc. When you look closely though, there are many differences. This website is
                    dedicated to three aspects that we felt are different from our lives now. These include education,
                    marriage, and family connections.
